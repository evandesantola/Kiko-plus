## Visualization of Total Query Points Returned by our Acceleration Data Structure (BVH)

The following video is a 3-D heat map representation of the computation required in our simulation.  The video above shows 10 iterations of a store falling from a wing.  The visualization is color coded by the value of a hardware agnostic indicator (the number of candidate triangles returned by our acceleration data structure) of the amount of computation required to compute the signed distance from points in each region to the mesh.  Thus, blue areas represent regions where signed distance queries are least expensive, while the red region represent areas where signed distance queries are the most expensive.


We see that by the nature of the implementation of our acceleration data structure, signed distance queries for points lying in certain regions of the mesh are much more expensive than queries for points in other regions.  Additionally, we see that such regions change positions as the simulation progresses.  


We thus see that we must perform some sort of load balancing if we wish to obtain better speedup results.
